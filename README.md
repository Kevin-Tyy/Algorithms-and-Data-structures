  vector<string> words = {"Don't", "forget", "to", "star", "and", "share", "it"};

  // Shuffle the vector of strings randomly
  random_shuffle(words.begin(), words.end());

  // Create an iterator to iterate through the vector
  vector<string>::iterator it = words.begin();

  // Continuously output the next word in the vector until reaching the end
  while (it != words.end()) {
    cout << *it << " ";
    it++;
  }

  cout << endl;

  return 0;
